PCA was performed on micro-SORS spectra collected on mock-up layered samples described in Chapter 2, section 2.2.3 and in the attachment 2c (samples set 2, Figure 4.1). The analysis was performed on each series of the samples individually, so that each data set consists in 16 spectra (a spectrum collected at imaged position and 15 spectra collected at different defocusing positions, from 100 to 1500 µm of defocusing, with steps of 100 µm). On each sample, 10 micro-SORS series were collected, so that the total amount of spectra is 160 per sample. After PCA, averaged scores values were calculated for all defocusing distances, to compare them with the average ratio values manually calculated.  Figure 4.1. Sample set 2. The ratio of Raman bands intensity of whewellite and calcite (W/C) is displayed, as well as the thickness of the layers. Adapted from [33].

The experiments were carried out using Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR800 Raman spectrometer equipped with a Peltier cooled CCD detector (1024 x 128 pixels) and coupled with an Olympus BX41 microscope. For all the measurements, 785 nm excitation laser and 20x microscope objective (WD 1.3mm, NA 0.4) were used. The spectra were acquired at imaged (in focus) position and progressively enlarging the distance between the sample and the microscope objective. 10 defocusing series were performed, from imaged position to 1500 μm defocusing distance (defocusing step = μm 100) . The spectra were collected with a laser intensity of 100 mW and with an acquisition time of 100s (10s and 10 co-additions).
